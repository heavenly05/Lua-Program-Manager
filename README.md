# Lua Program Manager

A Lua-based script designed to manage other Lua programs. It provides functionality to create, update, remove, and load Lua scripts into a main file (`main.lua`).

## Features

- **Create New Program**: Create a new Lua program by copying the contents of `main.lua`.
- **Update Existing Program**: Update an existing Lua program with the contents of `main.lua`.
- **Remove Program**: Delete an existing Lua program.
- **Load Program into Main**: Load the contents of a Lua program into `main.lua`, replacing its contents.

## Prerequisites

- Lua 5.1.5 (recommended version)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/heavenly05/Lua-Program-Manager.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```sh
   cd Lua-Program-Manager
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the script:**

   ```sh
   lua program_manager.lua
   ```

2. **Select an option from the menu to get started:**

   - `1 - Create a new Program`
   - `2 - Update An Existing Program`
   - `3 - Remove A Program`
   - `4 - Load a Program into Main`
   - `5 - Quit`

## Functions

- **clearconsole()**: Clears the console output.
- **mkdir(path)**: Creates a directory at the specified path (works on Windows).
- **contains(t, val)**: Checks if a table contains a specified value.
- **fileexists(path)**: Checks if a file exists at the specified path.
- **mkfile(path)**: Creates a new file at the specified path.
- **direxis(dir)**: Checks if a directory exists at the specified path (works on Windows).

## Adding New Features

You can easily add new features by editing the `program_manager.lua` file. To add a new option, follow these steps:

### 1. Add a new option to the list:

```lua
local list = {
    option1 = {
        title = "1 - Create a new Program"
    },
    option2 = {
        title = "2 - Update An Existing Program"
    },
    option3 = {
        title = "3 - Remove A Program"
    },
    option4 = {
        title = "4 - Load a Program into Main"
    },
    option5 = {
        title = "5 - Quit"
    },
    option6 = {
        title = "6 - New Feature" -- Add your new option here
    }
}
```

### 2. Add a corresponding action in the `init` function:

```lua
function list.option6:action() -- Define the action for the new option
    print("This is a new feature!")
    -- Add your feature code here
end

local function init()
    if not direxis("programs") then
       mkdir("programs")
    end

    if not fileexists("main.lua") then 
        mkfile("main.lua")
    end

    -- Actions for existing options...

    function list.option6:action() -- Initialize the action for the new option
        print("This is a new feature!")
        -- Add your feature code here
    end

    print("Welcome to program manager! - (created by Heaven)\n")
    print("Select an option to get Started.\n")

    print(list)
end

init()
```
